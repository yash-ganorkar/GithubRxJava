# GitHubRxJava: Interacting w/ GitHub's API using Retrofit & RxJava

The purpose of this project is to make use of some of RxJava's core constructs and see how it can be used in an Android application. In this project, we'll look at how to make network calls using [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

Please see the [tutorial](https://github.com/arriolac/GitHubRxJava/wiki/Tutorial) for more info.

Thank you [Chris Arriola](https://github.com/arriolac) for sharing this tutorial.
